# Spider graph execution engine

This is a graph execution engine called "Spider" written in Java. And the main function is to support developers to arrange operators in a graphical configuration manner.

The advantage of the graphical configuration is to enable developers to better maintain and develop business code.

The current plan for "Spider" is follows:
* Configure operators in a json file so that operators can form a graph.
* Support hot deployment.
* Visualize the json graph.
